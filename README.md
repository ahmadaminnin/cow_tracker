# cow_tracking

Cow tracking implemented with YOLOv4, SORT, and TensorFlow. This study is taken from https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort and modified to be applicable for tracking herd of cows. In consideration of high-speed processing, the appearance features used in deepsort are removed.

## Getting Started
To get started, install the proper dependencies either via Anaconda or Pip. I recommend Anaconda route for people using a GPU as it configures CUDA toolkit version for you.

### Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-gpu
```

### Pip
(TensorFlow 2 packages require a pip version >19.0.)
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```
### Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you are not using Conda Environment and haven't set up CUDA yet)
Make sure to use CUDA Toolkit version 10.1 as it is the proper version for the TensorFlow version used in this repository.

## Downloading Official YOLOv4 Pre-trained Weights
Our object tracker uses YOLOv4 to make the object detections, which deep sort then uses to track. There exists an official pre-trained YOLOv4 object detector model that is able to detect 80 classes. For easy demo purposes we will use the pre-trained weights for our tracker.
Download pre-trained yolov4.weights file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT

Copy and paste yolov4.weights from your downloads folder into the 'data' folder of this repository.

If you want to use yolov4-tiny.weights, a smaller model that is faster at running detections but less accurate, download file here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights

## Running the Tracker with YOLOv4
To implement the object tracking using YOLOv4, first we convert the .weights into the corresponding TensorFlow model which will be saved to a checkpoints folder. Then all we need to do is run the object_tracker.py script to run our object tracker with YOLOv4, DeepSort and TensorFlow.
```bash
# Convert darknet weights to tensorflow model
python save_model.py --model yolov4 

# Run yolov4 deep sort object tracker on video
python object_tracker.py --video ./data/video/cow.mp4 --output ./outputs/cow_tracking.mp4 --model yolov4
<!-- 
# Run yolov4 deep sort object tracker on webcam (set video flag to 0)
python object_tracker.py --video 0 --output ./outputs/webcam.avi --model yolov4 -->
```
The output flag allows you to save the resulting video of the object tracker running so that you can view it again later. Video will be saved to the path that you set. (outputs folder is where it will be if you run the above command!)
